Greater Los Angeles Commuting Tool 

This is an ASP.net Core web app, built primarily on top of MVC Core for the purposes of mapping where residents live in respect to where they travel throughout Los Angeles.

An ArcGIS web api is used to display a map of Los Angeles. An ArcGIS widget manages the address search area.  Address searches may be limited to the Los Angeles Region.
